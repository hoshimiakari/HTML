     <h4> 
         <p>The Korean culture is one of the oldest continuous cultures in the whole wide world. Today, starker cultural differences exist in todayâ€™s Korea, which has been split into North and South Korea. However, originally this cultural and historical heritage was shared quite identically across the entire Korean peninsula and even southern Manchuria.
Korean culture comprises all of its history, customs, traditions, and beliefs. It has been shaped by each of its different dynasties, wars, changes in religious beliefs, the modernization of the world as a whole, and many other customs and traditions that have passed on between generations, experiencing slight changes with each generational pass. The lasting tensions between North and South Korea, which were split into their separate countries in 1945, continue to shape up both countries today.
         On a perhaps more visible surface, Korean culture also consists of its food, holidays, national sports, and societal norms, as well as its popular culture in the form of music, movies, dramas, and fashion. And those are just some of the small pieces of what the culture is as a whole.</p>
